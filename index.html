  <h2>Hypothesis: The Major Early Church Fathers (the Ancient and Influential Christian Theologians Who Established the Intellectual, Doctrinal, and Practical Foundations of Orthodox Christianity) Tended to Live Further Away from the Locations Where the First Seven Ecumenical Councils Were Held Rather Than Closer</h2>
  <p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: black; padding: 1em; background-color: #F5E1FD;">"<em>An Ecumenical Synod may be defined as a synod the decrees of which have found acceptance by the Church in the whole world. It is not necessary
  to make a council ecumenical that the number of bishops present should be large, there were but 325 at Nice, and 150 at I. Constantinople; it is not necessary that it should be assembled with the intention of its being ecumenical, such was
  not the case with I. Constantinople; it is not necessary that all parts of the world should have been represented or even that the bishops of such parts should have been invited. All that is necessary in that its decrees find ecumenical
    acceptance afterwards, and its ecumenical character be universally recognized.</em>"<br>- Henry R. Percival</p>

<p><b>Figure 1</b> is an interactive map of the Roman Empire adorned with the associated locations of the Early Church Fathers, both before the Council Nicaea (Ante-Nicene) and after (Nicene and Post-Nicene), and the seven ecumenical councils (representing four unique locations). The size of the circle, furthermore, correlates to the number of Church Fathers at that exact location (for example, there are eight Ante-Nicene Fathers in Alexandria, Egypt). This map uses a Mercator projection. Hovering over each location with a cursor yields further information about each point, including
  all the Early Church Fathers associated with that location, the name of the location, the council that the given location is closest to, and the distance (in km) the given location is from its closest council. The interactive legend allows you to click on any of the options (Ante-Nicene, Nicene and Post-Nicene, and Ecumenical Councils) to highlight them indiviually on the map.</p>
<p><b>Figure 2</b> is a bar chart that displays each of the four locations of the ecumenical councils (Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon). The bars depict the number of Church Fathers that are closer to the given council than any of the others (for example, St. Augustine of Hippo is one of 48 saints that are closest to Ephesus over Nicaea, Constantinople, or Chalcedon). These bars are layered in such a way
  that the total count is given, but the colors distinguish between the Ante-Nice and Nicene/Post-Nicene Fathers. The chart is interactive, so hovering the cursor over a section of the bar yields the exact count for each period of the Early Church Fathers</p>
<p><b>Figure 3</b> is a binned histogram that depicts the distance of the Church Fathers (from their home location) to the nearest council location. The bins increase by increments of 500 km, and the sum of the Church Fathers withing that distance from the nearest council is displayed by the layered bar. Similarly with <b>Figure 2</b>, the graph is interactive; hovering 
  over the sections of the bars with the cursor will yield the exact count of Fathers in that section and the period of Church Fathers that it represents.</p>

<ul>
  <li><small>The data that constitutes the list of names and the corresponding locations of the Early Church Fathers comes from the 38-volume <em>Early Church Fathers</em> set edited by Philip Schaff, Henry Wace, and others, published by Hendrickson Publishers in 1996. The list of the Church Fathers used comes here from all the Fathers that have works included in the set, in addition to other historically important figures mentioned by the authors, but not with included works. The locations associated with each Father derive from where they held their highest position. For example, although John Chrysostom was born in Antioch, he is best known as the archbishop of Constantinople. Thus, Constantinople is his recorded location.</small></li>
  <li><small>The data that constitutes the latitude and longitude coordinates of each unique location comes from the website <em>https://latitude.to/</em>. In cases where the ancient city associated with the Church Father no longer exists, the closest modern equivalent was chosen instead (for example, Nicaea was located where Iznik, Turkey, stands today; I therefore used the coordinates for Iznik for the location of Nicaea).</small></li>
  <li><small>The data that constitutes the the map of Ancient Rome comes from a geojson file provided by <b>klokantech</b> on GitHub. The link to the repository is as follows: <em>https://github.com/klokantech/roman-empire</em></small></li>
  <li><small>All .csv files used for this project were created by me using the sources listed above.</small></li>
